### Hi there 👋
- :construction_worker: I'm structural engineer with passion to coding.
- Check my pyRebar for pyRevit extension, if you use Revit for reinforcement modelling. I don't work in Revit that often anymore but I try to make it viable for recent Revit and pyRevit version.
- Youtube and more structural coding examples coming soon!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwolinski/)
